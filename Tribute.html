            Elon Musk is a South African-born American businessman, best known as the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and owner of X (formerly Twitter). He also founded or co-founded companies like Neuralink, The Boring Company, OpenAI, and xAI.<br>

            He became wealthy after founding Zip2 and PayPal, then moved on to revolutionize space travel with reusable rockets (SpaceX) and electric vehicles (Tesla). In 2022, he acquired Twitter and rebranded it as X.<br>

            Musk has become a polarizing political figure. He supported far-right causes, was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. election, and briefly served as a senior advisor to President Trump in 2025 before starting his own political party. His public comments and Twitter policies have drawn criticism for promoting misinformation, conspiracy theories, and hate speech.<br>

            As of May 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth at $424.7 billion, making him the world’s richest person.<br>
